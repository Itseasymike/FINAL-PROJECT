	<h1>The Life of Pablo</h1>

	<!--COURTESY OF WIKIPEDIA-->
	<p>The Life of Pablo is the eighth studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was released on February 14, 2016, by Roc-A-Fella Records, GOOD Music and Def Jam Recordings. Recording sessions took place from 2013 to 2016, in Italy, Mexico, Canada and the United States. Production on the album was handled by West alongside a variety of producers such as Mike Dean, Noah Goldstein, Metro Boomin, Rick Rubin, Hudson Mohawke, and more. He also enlisted a wide array of guest vocalists, including Ty Dolla Sign, Desiigner, Kid Cudi, The-Dream, Chance the Rapper, Rihanna and Frank Ocean, among others. The album was preceded by the release of the promotional singles "Facts", "Real Friends", "No More Parties in LA", and "30 Hours" as part of West's GOOD Fridays giveaways.</p>
	<p>West premiered The Life of Pablo on February 11, 2016, at the Madison Square Garden as part of his Yeezy Season 3 fashion show, in collaboration with Adidas. The album was initially launched exclusively through the streaming service Tidal after several last-minute recording sessions and publicized finalizations to its track sequencing and title. Following the album's streaming release on Tidal, West continued to make alterations to the music, declaring it "a living breathing changing creative expression."[4] A largely updated version of the album, which included alternate mixes and other changes, was made available on other streaming services and for digital purchase on his website on April 1, 2016; no official physical CD release is planned. Def Jam confirmed that the album would receive further alterations in the following months.[5] The album was supported by the singles "Famous", "Father Stretch My Hands" and "Fade"</p>
	<p>The Life of Pablo received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular attention drawn to the fragmented, unfinished nature of its composition and release. On April 12, 2016, following Tidal's disclosure of its streaming data and the album's release to competing streaming services, The Life of Pablo debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming West's seventh consecutive number one album on the chart and the first album to reach the summit primarily through streaming. Its initial exclusive release on Tidal resulted in a large increase in subscribers to the service and 250 million streams in the first 10 days. The album received over 500,000 illegal downloads within the first three days of its release.</p>
